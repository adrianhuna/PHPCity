# PHPCity

PHPCity is an implementation of city metaphor visualization, and provides visualization of PHP projects
which are implemented in object-oriented fashion. The most famous city metaphor visualisation project
is probably [Code City](http://wettel.github.io/codecity.html) project but there is also [JSCity](https://github.com/aserg-ufmg/JSCity)
for visualizing javascript cities. This metaphor is implemented
using similar technologies as that are found in JSCity metaphor, however, our metaphor focuses
on different aspects of software projects.

There are only 5 levels of buldings' width and height that are the same for all cities. As a result of this
design decision, you cannot compare two cities relative to each other. By limiting the number of levels
city skyline looks more realistic.

Our adaptation of Code City metaphor is implemented in TypeScript and uses [three.js](threejs.org) library for rendering.
PHPCity is focused on classes/interfaces and their namespaces. Districts of a city represent namespaces,
and classes and interfaces are represented by buildings. Hierarchy of namespaces is represented by districts
stacked on top of another. Number of attributes, number of methods, and lines of code are metrics that can be
mapped on buildings' height and width.

Positions of districts and buildings are calculated as 2D bin packing problem. [2D bin packing library](https://github.com/jakesgordon/bin-packing)
was used in order to find the best positions for city elements, thus this visualization creates the most
compact cities possible.

<a name="visualize-custom-project"></a>You can see the visualization in action here on [github pages](https://adrianhuna.github.io/PHPCity).
There are multiple demo projects to showcase. You can select a project from select box in top menu and a city
visualization will load.

In order to visualize your own PHP project, you will need to generate JSON file describing your project. Please,
see instructions in [backend part](https://github.com/adrianhuna/PHPCity/backend) of this project.
